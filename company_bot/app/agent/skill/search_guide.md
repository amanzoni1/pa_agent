# Skill: Effective Search Strategy

When the user asks for information about the company or products:

1. **Keywords**: Extract 2-3 specific keywords from the user's query.
2. **Tool Use**: Call the `internet_search` tool with these keywords.
3. **Verification**: If the search returns no results, try broader keywords.
4. **Citation**: Always mention where you found the information.
